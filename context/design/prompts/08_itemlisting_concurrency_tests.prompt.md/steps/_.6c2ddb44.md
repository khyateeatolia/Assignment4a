# ItemListing Concurrency and Advanced Test Cases

## Project Context

You are working on a student marketplace system called "SwapIt" (CampusCloset) that enables verified users to list items, place bids, communicate through threads, and browse available listings. This is part of Assignment 4a for a Software Design course.

## Current Status

* **ItemListing concept**: Fully implemented with comprehensive test suite
* **Database**: MongoDB Atlas with npm:mongodb driver
* **Testing Framework**: Deno with principle-based test structure
* **Current Test Coverage**: 6 principles with 34 test scenarios

## Request

Please add the following **advanced test cases** to the existing ItemListing test suite to enhance coverage for concurrency and edge cases:

### **Required Test Cases:**

1. **Concurrent Bid Acceptance**
   * Test scenario where multiple bids are accepted simultaneously on the same listing
   * Verify that only one bid can be accepted and the listing status changes correctly
   * Test race conditions in bid acceptance logic
   * Ensure database consistency during concurrent operations

2. **Database Transaction Failures During Updates**
   * Simulate database connection failures during listing updates
   * Test rollback scenarios when database operations fail
   * Verify error handling and data consistency during failures
   * Test recovery mechanisms

3. **Concurrent Listing Updates by Same User**
   * Test scenario where the same user updates a listing multiple times simultaneously
   * Verify that updates are applied correctly and consistently
   * Test for data corruption or lost updates
   * Ensure proper event emission for all updates

## Implementation Requirements

### **Test Structure:**

* Add these as **new test scenarios** within the existing 6 principles
* Follow the same LikertSurvey format and naming conventions
* Use the existing mock services and fake data infrastructure
* Maintain compatibility with the current test suite

### **Technical Requirements:**

* Use **Promise.all()** or similar for concurrent operations
* Implement **proper error handling** for database failures
* Use **setTimeout()** or **Promise.race()** for timing-based tests
* Ensure **database cleanup** after each test
* Follow existing **assertion patterns** and error checking

### **Test Data:**

* Create additional fake data for concurrency scenarios
* Use existing `fakeUserIds` and `fakeListingData` where possible
* Generate multiple concurrent operations with realistic timing

### **Expected Outcomes:**

* **Concurrent Bid Acceptance**: Should handle race conditions gracefully
* **Database Failures**: Should maintain data integrity and proper error reporting
* **Concurrent Updates**: Should prevent data corruption and ensure consistency

## Integration Notes

* These tests should be added to the existing `ItemListingConcept.test.ts` file
* Maintain the current test structure and organization
* Ensure all new tests pass with the existing implementation
* Use the same database connection and cleanup patterns

Generate the additional test scenarios that can be integrated into the existing test suite without breaking current functionality.
