# MessagingThread Concept Implementation - New Simplified Design

## Context

You are implementing the MessagingThread concept for a student marketplace system (SwapIt). This is a simplified version that enables private communication between any users on the platform, with optional integration for seller-buyer exchanges around specific listings.

## Concept Specification

### Purpose

Enable private communication between any users on the platform, with optional integration for seller-buyer exchanges around specific listings.

### Types

* ThreadId
* ListingId
* UserId
* MessageId
* Message

### State

```
threads: Map<ThreadId -> { 
    listingId?: ListingId, 
    participants: Set<UserId>, 
    messages: List<MessageId> 
}]
messages: Map<MessageId -> { 
    sender: UserId, 
    text: String, 
    attachments?: List<Url>, 
    timestamp: Timestamp, 
    flagged?: Boolean 
}]
```

### Actions

* `start_thread(initiator: UserId, recipient: UserId, listingId?: ListingId) -> ThreadId`
* `post_message(threadId: ThreadId, user: UserId, text: String, attachments?)`
* `flag_message(threadId: ThreadId, messageId: MessageId, reason: String)`

### Notifications

* NewMessage(ThreadId, MessageId)
* MessageFlagged(ThreadId, MessageId)

### Notes

* Moderation is folded into UserAccount â€” flagging triggers a review by system admins via event emission, not a separate concept
* Threads are removed if either participant deletes their profile
* Threads can be general conversations between any users or specific to a listing
* When listingId is provided, the thread is associated with that listing for context
* Sellers and buyers can use this feature to arrange exchanges, but it's not enforced

## Technical Requirements

### Technology Stack

* **Runtime**: Deno
* **Database**: MongoDB (using `npm:mongodb` driver)
* **Testing**: Deno test framework
* **Language**: TypeScript

### Implementation Requirements

1. **Core Implementation File**: `src/concepts/MessagingThread/MessagingThreadConcept.ts`
   * Implement the MessagingThreadConcept class
   * Use MongoDB collections for persistence
   * Include proper error handling with custom error classes
   * Implement all required actions

2. **Error Classes**: `src/concepts/MessagingThread/MessagingThreadErrors.ts`
   * Create appropriate error classes for different failure scenarios
   * Follow the pattern used in other concepts (UserAccount, ItemListing, Bidding)

3. **Types and Interfaces**: `src/concepts/MessagingThread/types.ts`
   * Define all necessary TypeScript types and interfaces
   * Include event payload interfaces

4. **Mock Services**: `src/concepts/MessagingThread/mock-services.ts`
   * Mock EventBus implementation
   * Database setup utilities for testing
   * Follow the pattern from other concepts

5. **Fake Data**: `src/concepts/MessagingThread/fake-data.ts`
   * Helper functions to generate fake test data
   * Include various scenarios for testing

6. **Test Suite**: `src/concepts/MessagingThread/MessagingThreadConcept.test.ts`
   * Comprehensive test suite following LikertSurvey format
   * Test all actions and error scenarios
   * Include performance and usability tests
   * Test both general messaging and listing-specific messaging

## Key Design Principles

### Simplified Communication

* Any user can start a thread with any other user
* No complex authorization or enforcement mechanisms
* Optional listing context for seller-buyer coordination

### Database Design

* Use MongoDB ObjectIds for all entity IDs
* Proper indexing for efficient queries
* Clean separation between threads and messages collections

### Error Handling

* Custom error classes for different failure scenarios
* Clear, descriptive error messages
* Proper validation of inputs

### Testing Strategy

* Follow the LikertSurvey principle-based testing approach
* Test correctness, robustness, performance, usability, maintainability, and testability
* Include edge cases and error scenarios
* Test both general and listing-specific messaging

## Implementation Notes

1. **Thread Creation**: The `start_thread` method should create a thread between any two users, with optional listing context
2. **Message Posting**: Only thread participants can post messages
3. **Flagging**: Any user can flag messages for moderation
4. **No Pickup Tracking**: This concept does not handle pickup completion - that's handled elsewhere
5. **Event Emission**: Emit appropriate events for integration with other concepts

## Expected Deliverables

Please provide:

1. Complete TypeScript implementation files
2. Comprehensive test suite with fake data
3. Mock services for testing
4. Error classes for proper error handling
5. Clear documentation and comments

The implementation should be production-ready, well-tested, and follow the established patterns from the other concepts in the system.
