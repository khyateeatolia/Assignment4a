# response:

Okay, let's address these concerns and implement the necessary fixes and debugging steps.

The primary goal is to make the `withdraw_bid` functionality robust, ensure test isolation, and correctly handle error assertions, keeping Deno's testing framework and string-based enums in mind.

***

## 1. `BiddingErrors.ts` - Updated for Robustness

We'll introduce a new error type for the unexpected internal state.

```typescript
// src/BiddingErrors.ts (or wherever your errors are defined)

import { ObjectId } from "https://deno.land/x/mongo@v0.32.0/mod.ts"; // Assuming ObjectId import path

export class CustomError extends Error {
    constructor(message: string, name: string) {
        super(message);
        this.name = name;
        // This is necessary when extending Error in older JS/TS environments
        // but often handled by modern compilers. Good practice to include.
        Object.setPrototypeOf(this, CustomError.prototype);
    }
}

export class BidNotFoundError extends CustomError {
    constructor(bidId: string) {
        super(`Bid with ID ${bidId} not found.`, "BidNotFoundError");
    }
}

export class BidAlreadyWithdrawnError extends CustomError {
    constructor(bidId: string) {
        super(`Bid with ID ${bidId} has already been withdrawn.`, "BidAlreadyWithdrawnError");
    }
}

export class UnauthorizedBidWithdrawalError extends CustomError {
    constructor(bidId: string, bidderId: string) {
        super(`User ${bidderId} is not authorized to withdraw bid ${bidId}.`, "UnauthorizedBidWithdrawalError");
    }
}

export class InvalidBidAmountError extends CustomError {
    constructor(amount: number | string) {
        super(`Invalid bid amount: ${amount}. Amount must be a positive finite number.`, "InvalidBidAmountError");
    }
}

// New error for unexpected internal failures during withdrawal
export class BidWithdrawalFailedUnexpectedlyError extends CustomError {
    constructor(bidId: string, details: string = "An unexpected error occurred during bid withdrawal.") {
        super(`Failed to withdraw bid ${bidId}: ${details}`, "BidWithdrawalFailedUnexpectedlyError");
    }
}
```

***

## 2. `BiddingConcept.ts` - Updated `withdraw_bid` Logic

The main changes here are:

1. **Debugging Logs**: Added `console.log` statements to trace the execution path and bid status.
2. **Latent Bug Fix**: Replaced the final `BidNotFoundError` with the new `BidWithdrawalFailedUnexpectedlyError`.
3. **BidStatus Consistency**: Double-check that `BidStatus.Active` and `BidStatus.Withdrawn` are correctly used as strings. Since the enum is string-based, `status: BidStatus.Active` will correctly query for `{ status: "Active" }`.

```typescript
// src/BiddingConcept.ts (snippet for withdraw_bid method)
// Assuming other necessary imports like BidId, UserId, BidStatus, BidWithdrawnEvent, BiddingEventTopics, etc.

import { Collection, ObjectId, FindAndModifyOptions } from "https://deno.land/x/mongo@v0.32.0/mod.ts";
import { 
    BidNotFoundError, 
    BidAlreadyWithdrawnError, 
    UnauthorizedBidWithdrawalError,
    BidWithdrawalFailedUnexpectedlyError // Import the new error
} from "./BiddingErrors.ts"; // Adjust path as needed

// Define your Bid and Event types, BidId, UserId, BidStatus here or import them
// Example (placeholders if not provided):
export type BidId = ObjectId;
export type UserId = ObjectId;
export type ListingId = ObjectId;

export enum BidStatus {
    Active = "Active",
    Withdrawn = "Withdrawn",
}

export interface Bid {
    _id: BidId;
    listingId: ListingId;
    bidderId: UserId;
    amount: number;
    timestamp: Date;
    status: BidStatus;
}

export interface BidWithdrawnEvent {
    bidId: string;
    listingId: string;
    bidderId: string;
    amount: number;
    timestamp: Date;
}

// Mock EventBus for example
class MockEventBus {
    private events: Map<string, any[]> = new Map();
    publish(topic: string, event: any) {
        if (!this.events.has(topic)) {
            this.events.set(topic, []);
        }
        this.events.get(topic)?.push(event);
        // console.log(`[EventBus] Published to ${topic}:`, event); // Keep this for debugging
    }
    clearEvents() {
        this.events.clear();
    }
    getEvents(topic: string) {
        return this.events.get(topic) || [];
    }
}
const BiddingEventTopics = {
    BidWithdrawn: "BidWithdrawn",
    // ... other topics
};

export class BiddingConcept {
    private bidsCollection: Collection<Bid>;
    private eventBus: MockEventBus; // Assuming eventBus is injected/mocked

    constructor(bidsCollection: Collection<Bid>, eventBus: MockEventBus) {
        this.bidsCollection = bidsCollection;
        this.eventBus = eventBus;
    }

    // ... other methods like place_bid, get_bids, get_current_high

    async withdraw_bid(bidId: BidId, bidder: UserId): Promise<void> {
        console.log(`[DEBUG - withdraw_bid] Attempting to withdraw bid ${bidId.toHexString()} by user ${bidder.toHexString()}`);

        const updateResult = await this.bidsCollection.findOneAndUpdate(
            { 
                _id: bidId,
                bidderId: bidder, // Ensure the bidder matches
                status: BidStatus.Active // Ensure the bid is still active
            },
            { $set: { status: BidStatus.Withdrawn } },
            { returnDocument: 'before' } as FindAndModifyOptions // Get the document before the update
        );

        if (!updateResult.value) {
            console.log(`[DEBUG - withdraw_bid] findOneAndUpdate failed for bid ${bidId.toHexString()}. Checking specific reasons...`);

            const existingBid = await this.bidsCollection.findOne({ _id: bidId });
            
            if (!existingBid) {
                console.log(`[DEBUG - withdraw_bid] Bid ${bidId.toHexString()} does not exist.`);
                throw new BidNotFoundError(bidId.toHexString());
            }
            
            console.log(`[DEBUG - withdraw_bid] Existing bid ${bidId.toHexString()} found with status: ${existingBid.status}, bidder: ${existingBid.bidderId.toHexString()}`);

            if (existingBid.status === BidStatus.Withdrawn) {
                console.log(`[DEBUG - withdraw_bid] Bid ${bidId.toHexString()} is already withdrawn.`);
                throw new BidAlreadyWithdrawnError(bidId.toHexString());
            }
            
            if (!existingBid.bidderId.equals(bidder)) {

            // BUT `findOneAndUpdate` still returned `null`.
            // This is an unexpected state, possibly a very rare race condition or an underlying DB issue
            // where `status: BidStatus.Active` in the find query didn't match, but a subsequent direct find
            // shows it's still active.
            console.error(`[ERROR - withdraw_bid] Unexpected failure for bid ${bidId.toHexString()}: bid exists, active, and belongs to bidder, but findOneAndUpdate failed.`);
            throw new BidWithdrawalFailedUnexpectedlyError(bidId.toHexString(), "Atomic update failed without clear reason.");
        }

        const bid = updateResult.value;
        console.log(`[DEBUG - withdraw_bid] Successfully withdrew bid ${bid._id.toHexString()}.`);

        // Emit the withdrawal event
        const event: BidWithdrawnEvent = {

        };
        this.eventBus.publish(BiddingEventTopics.BidWithdrawn, event);
    }
}
```

## 3. `BiddingConcept.test.ts` - Updated Tests

Key changes:

1. **Deno `asserts` import**: Using `assertRejects` for cleaner error assertions.
2. **Aggressive Logging**: Added `console.log` statements in `beforeEach` and around `withdraw_bid` calls in the failing tests to truly understand the state.
3. **Error Assertions**: Changed `expect().rejects.toBeInstanceOf` (conceptual) to Deno's `assertRejects`.

            // "P1.2: should retrieve all active bids for a listing, sorted by amount and timestamp": async () => { /* ... */ },
            // "P1.3: should retrieve the current highest bid ID for a listing": async () => { /* ... */ },
            // "P1.4: should return null for get_current_high if no active bids exist on a listing": async () => { /* ... */ },
            // ... and so on for P2.1, P2.2, P2.3, P2.7 to P2.11, P3, P4, P5, P6
        });
    },
    // Teardown after all tests in the file have run
    async afterAll() {
        console.log("\n[TEST HOOK] Running afterAll teardown...");
        await bidsCollection.deleteMany({}); // Clean up one last time
        await client.close();
        console.log("[TEST HOOK] afterAll teardown complete. MongoDB client closed.");
    }
});
```

**Note on `get_bids` and `get_current_high`:**
For `P2.12` to pass, your `get_bids` and `get_current_high` methods *must* explicitly filter bids by `status: BidStatus.Active`. If they currently fetch all bids regardless of status, they need to be updated.

Example for `get_bids` (conceptual, adjust to your actual implementation):

```typescript
// Inside BiddingConcept.ts
async get_bids(listingId: ListingId): Promise<Bid[]> {
    return await this.bidsCollection.find({ 
        listingId: listingId,
        status: BidStatus.Active // Crucial filter
    }).sort({ amount: 1, timestamp: 1 }).toArray();
}

async get_current_high(listingId: ListingId): Promise<Bid | null> {
    const highestBid = await this.bidsCollection.find({
        listingId: listingId,
        status: BidStatus.Active // Crucial filter
    }).sort({ amount: -1, timestamp: 1 }).limit(1).toArray();
    
    return highestBid.length > 0 ? highestBid[0] : null;
}
```

## 4. Specific Debugging Steps to Verify Fixes

After implementing the code changes:

1. **Run Your Tests with Deno:**
   ```bash
   deno test BiddingConcept.test.ts --allow-net --allow-read --allow-env
   ```
   (Adjust `--allow-net`, `--allow-read`, `--allow-env` as per your Deno permissions needed for MongoDB connection).

2. **Analyze Console Output:**
   * **Focus on `[DEBUG - withdraw_bid]` logs:** Trace the execution path for each `withdraw_bid` call, especially for the failing tests (`P1.5`, `P1.6`, `P2.4`, `P2.5`, `P2.6`, `P2.12`).
   * **`[TEST SETUP]` logs:** Confirm that bids are created as `Active` initially.
   * **`[TEST DEBUG Px.x]` logs:** Check the `BidStatus` immediately before and after withdrawal attempts.
   * **Look for `findOneAndUpdate failed` messages:** If these appear followed by an unexpected status, it indicates a mismatch.

3. **Inspect MongoDB Directly (if needed):**
   * If the console logs don't fully explain the behavior, use a MongoDB client (e.g., `mongosh`) to connect to your `swapit_test_db`.

   * **Before running tests:** `db.bids.find({})` - should be empty.

   * **After a failing test run:** `db.bids.find({})` - inspect the actual `status` values in the `bids` collection for the `ObjectId`s that were involved in the failing tests. This is the ultimate source of truth for persistence.

   * **Key Question:** If a test fails with `BidAlreadyWithdrawnError`, is the bid's `status` field in MongoDB *actually* `"Withdrawn"` at the point where `findOneAndUpdate` failed?
     * If **YES**: There's a subtle test isolation issue where the bid got withdrawn unexpectedly *before* the intended `withdraw_bid` call. (Less likely with `deleteMany` and `generateObjectId` for each test, but possible if parallel test execution causes very tricky timing issues or a bug in `place_bid` sets it to `Withdrawn`.)
     * If **NO** (i.e., it's still `"Active"`): Then `findOneAndUpdate` is failing for some other reason, most likely the `status: BidStatus.Active` condition itself, implying a mismatch between how `BidStatus.Active` is interpreted by the MongoDB driver versus how it's stored, even with string enums. This would be very unusual but worth checking.

By following these steps, you should be able to precisely identify the remaining issues and achieve a 100% pass rate for your Bidding concept tests. The logging is crucial for understanding the dynamic state during test execution.
