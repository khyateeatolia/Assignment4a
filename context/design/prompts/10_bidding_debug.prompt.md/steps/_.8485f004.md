# Follow-up Analysis and Specific Fixes Needed

## Concerns with Previous Analysis

Your analysis was very thorough, but there are a few areas that need clarification and specific fixes for our implementation:

### 1. **BidStatus Enum Type Clarification**

You assumed numeric enums (`0`, `1`), but our actual implementation uses **string-based enums**:

```typescript
export enum BidStatus {
    Active = "Active",
    Withdrawn = "Withdrawn",
}
```

This means the mismatch hypothesis is still valid, but the values would be `"Active"` vs `"Active"` (which should match) rather than `0` vs `"Active"`.

### 2. **Test Framework Context**

We're using **Deno's built-in testing framework**, not Jest. The `instanceof` issue is still valid, but the context is different.

### 3. **Missing Parallel Test Considerations**

The analysis didn't fully account for potential race conditions in test execution, especially with our `beforeEach` cleanup and parallel test runs.

## Specific Fixes Needed

### 1. **Fix BidStatus Persistence Issues**

* Ensure `BidStatus` enum values are consistently stored and queried as strings
* Add debugging logs to verify actual status values in MongoDB
* Fix any mismatches between enum values and database storage

### 2. **Fix Error Type Assertions**

* Replace `instanceof` checks with `error.name` checks for better compatibility
* Ensure custom error classes properly set their `name` property
* Update all test assertions to use the more robust error checking approach

### 3. **Fix Test Isolation Issues**

* Ensure `beforeEach` cleanup is working correctly
* Add proper error handling for race conditions
* Verify that test data is properly isolated between tests

### 4. **Fix the Latent Bug in `withdraw_bid`**

* Replace the final `BidNotFoundError` fallback with a more appropriate error
* Add better error handling for unexpected internal states

## Request

Please provide:

1. **Updated `BiddingConcept.ts`** with fixes for BidStatus handling and error management
2. **Updated `BiddingConcept.test.ts`** with proper error assertions and debugging logs
3. **Updated `BiddingErrors.ts`** if needed for better error handling
4. **Specific debugging steps** to verify the fixes work correctly

Focus on making the implementation robust and the tests reliable, especially for the failing P1 and P2 test scenarios.
